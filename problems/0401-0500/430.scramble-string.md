### [430. Scramble String](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/scramble-string/description)

Given a string `s1`, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of `s1 = "great"`:

```
    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```

To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node `"gr"` and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string `"rgeat"`.

```
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```

We say that `"rgeat"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes `"eat"` and `"at"`, it produces a scrambled string `"rgtae"`.

```
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a
```

We say that `"rgtae"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, determine if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true
Explanation: As described above.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "a", s2 = "b"
Output: false
```

### Challenge

O(n3) time

### Notice

You can start scrambling from any binary tree legally built from `s1`, but you can not rebuild another binary tree while you are scrambling to get `s2`.
