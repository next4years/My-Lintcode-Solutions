### [74. First Bad Version](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/first-bad-version/description)

The code base version is an integer start from 1 to n. One day, someone committed a bad version in the code case, so it caused this version and the following versions are all failed in the unit tests. Find the first bad version.

You can call `isBadVersion` to help you determine which version is the first bad one. The details interface can be found in the code's annotation part.

### Example

```
Given n = 5:

    isBadVersion(3) -> false
    isBadVersion(5) -> true
    isBadVersion(4) -> true

Here we are 100% sure that the 4th version is the first bad version.
```

### Challenge

You should call *isBadVersion* as few as possible.

### Notice

Please read the annotation in code area to get the correct way to call isBadVersion in different language. For example, Java is `SVNRepo.isBadVersion(v)`

## 代码

```python
#class SVNRepo:
#    @classmethod
#    def isBadVersion(cls, id)
#        # Run unit tests to check whether verison `id` is a bad version
#        # return true if unit tests passed else false.
# You can use SVNRepo.isBadVersion(10) to check whether version 10 is a 
# bad version.
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @return: An integer which is the first bad version.
    """
    def findFirstBadVersion(self, n):
        # write your code here
        start, end = 1, n
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = start + (end - start) // 2
            if not SVNRepo.isBadVersion(mid):
                start = mid
            else:
                end = mid
                
        
        if SVNRepo.isBadVersion(start):
            return start
        if SVNRepo.isBadVersion(end):
            return end
```
