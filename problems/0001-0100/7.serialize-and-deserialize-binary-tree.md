### [7. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description)

Design an algorithm and write code to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Writing the tree to a file is called 'serialization' and reading back from the file to reconstruct the exact same binary tree is 'deserialization'.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input：{3,9,20,#,#,15,7}
Output：{3,9,20,#,#,15,7}
Explanation：
Binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},  denote the following structure:
	  3
	 / \
	9  20
	  /  \
	 15   7
it will be serialized {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input：{1,2,3}
Output：{1,2,3}
Explanation：
Binary tree {1,2,3},  denote the following structure:
   1
  / \
 2   3
it will be serialized {1,2,3}
```

Our data serialization use BFS traversal. This is just for when you got Wrong Answer and want to debug the input.

You can use other method to do serializaiton and deserialization.

### Notice

There is no limit of how you deserialize or serialize a binary tree, LintCode will take your output of `serialize` as the input of `deserialize`, it won't check the result of serialize.

## 思路

序列化时候采用队列实现广度优先搜索

反序列化采用两个队列进行反序列化
