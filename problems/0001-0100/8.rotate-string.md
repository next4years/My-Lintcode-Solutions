### [8. Rotate String](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/rotate-string/description)

Given a string(Given in the way of char array) and an offset, rotate the string by offset `in place`. (rotate from left to right).

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset = 3
Output: str = "efgabcd"	
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "efgabcd".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset = 0
Output: str = "abcdefg"	
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "abcdefg".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset = 1
Output: str = "gabcdef"	
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "gabcdef".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset =2
Output: str = "fgabcde"	
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "fgabcde".
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset = 10
Output: str = "efgabcd"	
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "efgabcd".
```

### Challenge

Rotate in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Notice

offset >= 0
the length of str >= 0
Make changes on the original input data

三步反转法的应用

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param str: An array of char
    @param offset: An integer
    @return: nothing
    """
    def rotateString(self, s, offset):
        # write your code here
        if not s:
            return ''
        if offset == 0:
            return s
        l = len(s)
        offset = offset % l
        self.reverse(s, 0, l-offset-1)
        self.reverse(s, l-offset, len(s) - 1)
        self.reverse(s, 0, len(s) - 1)
        return s
    
    def reverse(self, s, i, j):
        while i < j:
            tmp = s[i]
            s[i] = s[j]
            s[j] = tmp
            i += 1
            j -= 1  
```
