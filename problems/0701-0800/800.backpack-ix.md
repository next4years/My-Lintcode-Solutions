## 题目

### [800. Backpack IX](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/backpack-ix/description)

You have a total of `n` thousand yuan, hoping to apply for a university abroad. The application is required to pay a certain fee. Give the cost of each university application and the probability of getting the University's offer, and the number of university is `m`. If the economy allows, you can apply for multiple universities. Find the highest probability of receiving at least one offer.

### Example

```
Example 1:
	Input:  
		n = 10
		prices = [4,4,5]
		probability = [0.1,0.2,0.3]
	Output:  0.440
	
	Explanation：
	select the second and the third school. 
	

Example 2:
	Input: 
		n = 10
		prices = [4,5,6]
		probability = [0.1,0.2,0.3]
	Output:  0.370
	
	Explanation:
	select the first and the third school.
	
```

### Notice

0<=n<=10000,0<=m<=10000

## 思路

0-1背包型动态规划题目。

最重要的依然是问题的转换，学会用背包思想思考非背包描述的问题

因为设计到概率计算，可能思考有点麻烦些

九章给的题解则是另一种很棒的思路，可以做个参考

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: Your money
    @param prices: Cost of each university application
    @param probability: Probability of getting the University's offer
    @return: the  highest probability
    """
    def backpackIX(self, n, prices, probability):
        # write your code here
        
        # DP[n][m] n万元 前m个学校中 至少获得一份offer的最高可能性
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        m = len(prices)
        DP = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
        
        for j in range(1, m+1):
            for i in range(n, 1, -1):
                if i - prices[j-1] >= 0:
                    pre = DP[i - prices[j - 1]]
                    DP[i] = max(DP[i], (1 - pre)*probability[j-1] + pre)
                    
        return float(DP[n])
```

* 九章题解

  正难则反。
  计算一个offer都收不到的概率，然后减掉。
  使用0-1背包来计算收到0个offer的最小概率。

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: Your money
    @param prices: Cost of each university application
    @param probability: Probability of getting the University's offer
    @return: the  highest probability
    """
    def backpackIX(self, n, prices, probability):
        # write your code here
        dp = [1.0 for x in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(len(probability)):
            probability[i] = 1 - probability[i]
           
        for i in range(len(probability)):  
            j = n
            while j >= prices[i]:  
               dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-prices[i]] * probability[i])
               j = j - 1
        return 1 - dp[n]
```
