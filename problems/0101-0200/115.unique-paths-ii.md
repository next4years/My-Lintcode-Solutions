### [115. Unique Paths II](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/unique-paths-ii/description)

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

### Example

```
Example 1:
	Input: [[0]]
	Output: 1


Example 2:
	Input:  [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
	Output: 2
	
	Explanation:
	Only 2 different path.
	
```

### Notice

*m* and *n* will be at most 100.

坐标型动态规划题目

一个follow up，简单处理一下障碍物就行

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param obstacleGrid: A list of lists of integers
    @return: An integer
    """
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        # write your code here
        return self.solve(obstacleGrid)
        
    def solve(self, obstacleGrid):
        n = len(obstacleGrid)
        m = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        
        DP = [[0 for i in range(m)] for j in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    DP[0][0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0
                    continue
                if i == 0:
                    DP[i][j] = DP[i][j-1] if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0 else 0
                    continue
                if j == 0:
                    DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j] if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0 else 0
                    continue
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1:
                    DP[i][j] = DP[i][j-1] + DP[i-1][j]
                else:
                    DP[i][j] = 0
        return DP[n-1][m-1]
```
