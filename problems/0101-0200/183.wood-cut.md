### [183. Wood Cut](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/wood-cut/description)

Given n pieces of wood with length `L[i]` (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.

### Example

**Example 1**

```plain
Input:
L = [232, 124, 456]
k = 7
Output: 114
Explanation: We can cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 114cm long, however we can't cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 115cm long.
```

**Example 2**

```plain
Input:
L = [1, 2, 3]
k = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: It is obvious we can't make it.
```

### Challenge

O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.

### Notice

You couldn't cut wood into float length.

If you couldn't get >= *k* pieces, return `0`.

## 思路

满足能够得到>=k块的所有长度中，最后/最大的长度

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param L: Given n pieces of wood with length L[i]
    @param k: An integer
    @return: The maximum length of the small pieces
    """
    def woodCut(self, L, k):
        # write your code here
        if not L:
            return 0
            
        start, end = 1, max(L)
        
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if self.check(L, mid, k):
                start = mid
            else:
                end = mid
        if self.check(L, end, k):
            return end
        if self.check(L, start, k):
            return start
        return 0
        
                
    def check(self, L, mid, k):
        num = 0
        for item in L:
            if item < mid:
                continue
            num += (item // mid)
        return True if num >= k else False
```
