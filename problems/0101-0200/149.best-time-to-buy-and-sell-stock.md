### [149. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

### Example

**Example 1**

```plain
Input: [3, 2, 3, 1, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can buy at the third day and then sell it at the 4th day. The profit is 2 - 1 = 1
```

**Example 2**

```plain
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can buy at the 0th day and then sell it at the 4th day. The profit is 5 - 1 = 4
```

**Example 3**

```plain
Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: You can do nothing and get nothing.
```

## 思路

序列型动态规划题目

从0到$N-1$枚举$j$，即第$j$天卖出。时刻保存到当前为止的最低价格。最大的$P_j-P_i$即为答案

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param prices: Given an integer array
    @return: Maximum profit
    """
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        # write your code here
        return self.solve2(prices)
        
    def solve1(self, prices):
        
        n = len(prices)
        
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 0
            
        DP = [0 for i in range(n)] 
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                DP[i] = 0
                continue
            DP[i] = max(DP[i-1] + (prices[i] - prices[i-1]), prices[i] - prices[i-1])
        return max(DP)
        
    def solve2(self, prices):
        
        n = len(prices)
        
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 0
            
        min1 = prices[0]
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            res = max(res, prices[i] - min1)
            min1 = min(min1, prices[i])
        return res
```
