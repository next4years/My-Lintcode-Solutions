### [150. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description)

Given an array `prices`, which represents the price of a stock in each day.

You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, if you already have the stock, you must sell it before you buy again).

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
    1. Buy the stock on the second day at 1, and sell the stock on the third day at 2. Profit is 1.
    2. Buy the stock on the 4th day at 0, and sell the stock on the 5th day at 1. Profit is 1.
    Total profit is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No transaction, profit is 0.
```

## 思路

贪心法题目

买卖任意多次，那就是只要上升就卖出

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param prices: Given an integer array
    @return: Maximum profit
    """
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        # write your code here
        n = len(prices);
        
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 0;
        
        # 贪心：只要上升就卖
        res = 0;
        for i in range(0, n-1):
            res += max(prices[i+1] - prices[i], 0)
        return res; 
```
