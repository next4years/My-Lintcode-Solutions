### [1538. Card Game II](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/card-game-ii/description)

You are playing a card game with your friends, there are `n` cards in total. Each card costs `cost[i]` and inflicts `damage[i]` damage to the opponent. You have a total of `totalMoney` dollars and need to inflict at least `totalDamage` damage to win. And Each card can only be used once. Determine if you can win the game.

### Example

**Example1**

```plain
Input:
cost = [1,2,3,4,5]
damage = [1,2,3,4,5]
totalMoney = 10
totalDamage = 10

Output: true
Explanation: We can use the [1,4,5] to cause 10 damage, which costs 10.
```

**Example2**

```plain
Input:
cost = [1,2]
damage = [3,4]
totalMoney = 10
totalDamage = 10

Output: false
Explanation: We can only cause 7 damage at most.
```

## 思路

0-1背包问题
totalMoney相当于背包的容量，cost[i]相当于物品的容量，damage[i]相当于物品对应的价值.

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param cost: costs of all cards
    @param damage: damage of all cards
    @param totalMoney: total of money
    @param totalDamage: the damage you need to inflict
    @return: Determine if you can win the game
    """
    def cardGame(self, cost, damage, totalMoney, totalDamage):
        # Write your code here
        if not totalDamage:
            return True
        if not cost:
            return False
            
        n = len(cost)
        DP = [[0]*(totalMoney+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
        
        # DP[i][j] 前i个牌 组成成本j 得到的伤害
        DP[0][0] = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, totalMoney+1):
                DP[i][j] = DP[i - 1][j]
                if j - cost[i-1] >= 0:
                    DP[i][j] = max(DP[i - 1][j - cost[i-1]] + damage[i-1], DP[i][j])
                if totalDamage <= DP[i][j]:
                    return True
        
        return False
```
