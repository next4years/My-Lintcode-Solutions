### [1375. Substring With At Least K Distinct Characters](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/substring-with-at-least-k-distinct-characters/description)

Given a string `S` with only lowercase characters.

Return the number of substrings that contains at least `k` distinct characters.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "abcabcabca", k = 4
Output: 0
Explanation: There are only three distinct characters in the string.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "abcabcabcabc", k = 3
Output: 55
Explanation: Any substring whose length is not smaller than 3 contains a, b, c.
    For example, there are 10 substrings whose length are 3, "abc", "bca", "cab" ... "abc"
    There are 9 substrings whose length are 4, "abca", "bcab", "cabc" ... "cabc"
    ...
    There is 1 substring whose length is 12, "abcabcabcabc"
    So the answer is 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55.
```

### Notice

1. 10 ≤ length(S) ≤ 1,000,000
2. 1 ≤ k ≤ 26

## 思路

用hashmap

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param s: a string
    @param k: an integer
    @return: the number of substrings there are that contain at least k distinct characters
    """
    def kDistinctCharacters(self, s, k):
        # Write your code here
        if not s:
            return 0
        if len(s) < k:
            return 0
        
        cnt = 0
        d = {}
        for i in range(len(s)):
            j = i
            while len(d) < k and j < len(s):
                if s[j] not in d:
                    d[s[j]] = 1
                j += 1
            if len(d) >= k:
                cnt += len(s)-j+1
            d.clear()
        return cnt
```
