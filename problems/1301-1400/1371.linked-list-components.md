### [1371. Linked List Components](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/linked-list-components/description)

We are given `head`, the head node of a linked list containing **unique integer values**.

We are also given the list `G`, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in `G`, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively(the longest) in the linked list.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = 0->1->2->3, G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = 0->1->2->3->4, G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
```

### Notice

- If `N` is the length of the linked list given by `head`, 1 \leq N \leq 100001≤*N*≤10000.
- The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range`[0, N - 1]`.
- 1 \leq G.length \leq 100001≤*G*.*l**e**n**g**t**h*≤10000.
- `G` is a subset of all values in the linked list.
