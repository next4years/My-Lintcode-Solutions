### [534. House Robber II](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/house-robber-ii/description)

After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

### Example

**Example1**

```
Input:  nums = [3,6,4]
Output: 6
```

**Example2**

```
Input:  nums = [2,3,2,3]
Output: 6
```

### Notice

This is an extension of [House Robber](http://www.lintcode.com/problem/house-robber/).

## 思路

序列型动态规划。改为一圈房子。

思路就是通过分类讨论，化为两个序列型动态规划处理。

## 代码

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param nums: An array of non-negative integers.
    @return: The maximum amount of money you can rob tonight
    """
    def houseRobber2(self, nums):
        # write your code here
        return self.solve(nums);
    
    def solve(self, nums):
        
        n = len(nums);
        if n == 0: return 0;
        
        DP1 = [0 for i in range(3)];
        DP2 = [0 for i in range(3)];
        
        # 分偷和不偷第一栋房子讨论
        # 不偷第一栋房子，初始化为0，最后一栋房子可以偷，输出DP[n]
        # 偷第一栋房子，初始化为num[1]，最后一栋房子不可以偷，输出DP[n-1]
        
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if i == 1:
                DP1[1] = 0;           # 不偷第一栋房子
                DP2[1] = nums[0];     # 偷第一栋房子
                continue;
            DP1[i % 3] = max(DP1[(i-1) % 3], DP1[(i-2) % 3] + nums[i-1]); 
            DP2[i % 3] = max(DP2[(i-1) % 3], DP2[(i-2) % 3] + nums[i-1]); 
        res1 = DP1[n % 3];
        res2 = DP2[(n-1) % 3] if n > 1 else DP2[n % 3];
        
        return max(res1, res2);
```
