### [668. Ones and Zeroes](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/ones-and-zeroes/description)

In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of m `0s` and n `1s` respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only `0s` and `1s`.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m `0s` and n `1s`. Each `0` and `1` can be used at most once.

### Example

**Example1**

```
Input:
["10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"]
5
3
Output: 4
Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are "10", "0001", "1", "0"
```

**Example2**

```
Input:
["10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"]
7
7
Output: 5
Explanation: All strings can be formed by the using of 7 0s and 7 1s.
```

### Notice

1. The given numbers of `0s` and `1s` will both not exceed `100`
2. The size of given string array won't exceed `600`.

## 思路

双序列型动态规划

* 可以优化至二维数组

  

## 代码

```python

    """
    @param strs: an array with strings include only 0 and 1
    @param m: An integer
    @param n: An integer
    @return: find the maximum number of strings
